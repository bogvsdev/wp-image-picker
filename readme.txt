Useful plugin for displaying image associated with post whether it's thumbnail, uploaded or just pasted image.

== Description ==

This is a plugin for Wordpress that makes it easy to to display image from post in your template. Not all wordpress themes display images from posts as a thumbnail. Almost all themes support only post thumbnails, but editor not always sets post thumbnail. More often we just publish uploaded or external image. WP Image Picker plugin solves this problem.

Plugin by default searches for any kind of image in post (pasted image, uploaded image or thumbnail), but if nothing found, then plugin displays image by default, which you can upload or paste link to by yourself on plugin's setting page.

Supported formats of images: jpg, jpeg, bmp, png.
